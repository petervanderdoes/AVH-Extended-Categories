== Description ==

The AVH Extended Categories Widgets gives you three widgets for displaying categories.

1. Replacement of the default category widget to allow for greater customization.

1. A top categories widget. Shows the top X categories. This requires WordPress 2.8 or higher.

1. A Category Group widget. Shows categories from a group which is associated with the post/page that the visitor is looking at. Categories can be added to a group. Multiple groups can be made and every post/page can be associated with a different group. This requires WordPress 2.8 or higher.

The replacement widget gives you the following customizable options:

* Title of the widget.
* Display as List or Drop-down.
* Show number of posts (Count) after the category.
* Hide empty categories.
* Show categories hierarchical.
* Show categories up to a certain depth. (Requires WordPress 2.8 or higher).
* Sort by ID, Name, Count, Slug or manual order (Requires WordPress 3.3 or higher).
* Sort ascending or descending.
* Show RSS link after the category as text or image.
* Select which categories to show. (Requires WordPress 2.5.1 or higher).

The Top Categories widget gives you the following customizable options:

* Title of the widget.
* How many categories to show.
* Display as List or Drop-down.
* Show number of posts (Count) after the category.
* Sort by ID, Name, Count, Slug.
* Sort ascending or descending.
* Show RSS link after the category as text or image.
* Select which categories to show. (Requires WordPress 2.5.1 or higher).

The Category Group widget gives you the following customizable options:

* Title of the widget. Either per widget or per group.
* Display as List or Drop-down.
* Show number of posts (Count) after the category.
* Hide empty categories.
* Sort by ID, Name, Count, Slug.
* Sort ascending or descending.
* Show RSS link after the category as text or image.

You can set the following options for the Category Group Widget:

* Which group to show on the 'special' pages. The 'special' pages are: Home, Category archive, Tag archive, Daily/Monthly/Yearly archive, Author archive, Search results page.
* Which group to show when no group is associated with a post. Useful for older posts that don't have the association.
* Set the default group when editing or creating a post.

You can also select not to show the Category Group widget by selecting the group: None

== Support ==

= What about support? =
I created a support site at http://forums.avirtualhome.com where you can ask questions or request features.

= Depth selection =
Starting with version 2.0 and WordPress 2.8 you can select how many levels deep you want to show your categories. This option only works when you select Show Hierarchy as well.

Here is how it works: Say you have 5 top level categories and each top level has a number of children. You could manually select all the Top Level categories you want to show but now you can do the following:
You select to display all categories, select to Show hierarchy and select how many levels you want to show, in this case Toplevel only.

= I want to help and translate the plug-in =
I have setup a project in [Launchpad](https://translations.launchpad.net/avhextendedcategories/trunk) for translating the plug-in.

= Multiple Category Groups =
The following is an explanation how assigning multiple groups to page/post works.
 
Lets say you have the following groups:
Free Time
Theater
Movie
Music

Setup several Category Group widgets and associated each widget with one or more groups.
Widget 1 has association with Free Time
Widget 2 has association with Theater, Movie and Music
Widget 3 has association with Theater, Movie and Music

Page has associations the groups Free Time and Theater
* Widget 1: Shows categories of the Free Time group
* Widget 2: Shows categories of the Theater group.
* Widget 3: Not displayed

Page has associations the group Movie.
* Widget 1: Not displayed
* Widget 2: Shows categories of the Movie group.
* Widget 3: Not displayed


Page has associations the groups Free Time, Movie and Music
* Widget 1: Shows categories of the Free Time group
* Widget 2: Shows categories of the Movie or Music group.
* Widget 3: Shows categories of the Music or Movie group.
Whether Widget 2 shows Movie or Music depends on the creation order of groups. If Widget 2 shows Movie, Widget 3 will show Music but if Widget 2 shows Music, Widget 3 will show Movie.
